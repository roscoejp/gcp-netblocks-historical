Script taken from a [post by edvinerikson](https://gist.github.com/n0531m/f3714f6ad6ef738a3b0a#gistcomment-3337000).
Aim of this repo is to try to keep track of Google Cloud's netblock changes.

A Github Action is set to run every 15 minutes. If the netblocks listed at <http://www.gstatic.com/ipranges/cloud.json> change, the new list should be committed to the [cloud.txt file](./cloud.txt).
